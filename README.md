# About me

👋 Hi, I'm Pietro and I'm a Computer Science graduate.

🖌️ I'm your typical computer person, with a tiny bit of artistic tendencies.

🌩️ I'm currently studying and working hard to become a game developer, using Unity and Godot.

🧰 I also enjoy fiddling with different programming languages, engines, algorithms and everything related to CS.

Recent projects that I've been pursuing:
- 🌊 [rustic-wave-function-collapse](https://github.com/blazQ/rustic-wave-function-collapse): A Rust port of the WFC algorithm, used in procedural generation.
- ♦️ [napoleon-solitaire](https://github.com/blazQ/napoleon-solitaire): A Godot implementation of a classic Solitaire game, made as an entry point to the engine. I hope it will evolve in a fully fledged game.
- 🍷 [wine-cellar](https://github.com/blazQ/mpi-word-count): A serverless architecture for a home wine cellar, using AWS services emulated through Localstack.
- 📕 [mpi-word-count](https://github.com/blazQ/wine-cellar): A basic C Open-MPI implementation for parallelizing the word counting problem.
- ♬ [pentakey-dolores](https://github.com/blazQ/pentakey-dolores): A prototype for a web application that, backed by a darknet YOLOv3 RNN, can recognize musical score sheets and parse a MXML file for use in tools like [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/)
- 📃[retro-auctions](https://github.com/blazQ/retro-auctions): A very simple implementation of a retro-videogames auction decentralized app, based on a smart contract written in Solidity.
- ⚙️ Hardware Modding: Modifying older consoles and experimenting with circuits for future IoT projects. You can see a tiny example [here](img/20230819_120601.jpg).
