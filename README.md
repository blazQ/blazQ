# About me

üëã Hi, I'm Pietro and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Salerno!

üñåÔ∏è I'm your typical computer person, with a tiny bit of artistic tendencies.

üå©Ô∏è I'm currently studying for my Master's Degree in Cloud Computing, but I keep a vivid interest in all branches of IT.

üß∞ I also enjoy fiddling with the hardware, and I'm trying to mod a lot of my old consoles and learning circuitry.

Recent projects that I've been pursuing:

- üç∑ [wine-cellar](https://github.com/blazQ/mpi-word-count): A serverless architecture for a home wine cellar, using AWS services emulated through Localstack.
- üìï [mpi-word-count](https://github.com/blazQ/wine-cellar): A basic C Open-MPI implementation for parallelizing the word counting problem.
- ‚ô¨ DeepScoresV2 implementation to translate musical scores into musicXML format
- ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Modding: Modifying older consoles and experimenting with circuits for future IoT projects. You can see a tiny example [here](img/20230819_120601.jpg).

## Tech Stack

I'm constantly learning, and obviously no language is ever fully learnt.

I'm still at the beginning of my career, and there's still much to learn beside simply learning new tools and languages.
